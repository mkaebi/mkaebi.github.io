I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Insper Institute of Education and Research, in Brazil, with fellowship from the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). I hold a BSc in Economics, also from Insper, where I graduated summa cum laude.

I also work as a research assistant at Insper's [Finance and Macroeconomics Centre](https://cefim-insper.github.io/).

My research interests lie within the fields of empirical asset pricing and international finance. In particular,  I focus on the study of foreign exchange market dynamics, identifying novel common risk factors that price the cross-section of currency returns and on analysing how fundamental economic variables can shape currency investment decisions.
